# Basic Data Structures
Trying out basic data structure, List, Stakc, Queqe, Trees, sorting, traversal....

com.ds.search.binary (using recursion and loop both)
    binary search with Unit Test.  Complexity = log2(n);
com.ds.sort.selection
    SelectionSort(using recursion)
            Complexity = n*2;




     




     
     Queue of variable size using Array.
     #MyQueueArrayImpl
     
     Stack of variable size using Array.
          #MyStackArrayImpl
     
     QuickSort using recursion.




     LinkeDList - with insertion at start,end, arbitrary
                - remove at position.

     Tree - FunctionalTree - with depthFirstTraverse

     Tree - Binary Tree - InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder Traversal Recursive.


     Tree - Binary Tree - preOrder Traversal NoN - Recursive
     Tree - Binary Tree - IN_Order Traversal NoN - Recursive
     Tree - Binary Tree - IN_Order Traversal NoN - Recursive -- PENDING
     Tree - Binary Tree ---levelOrderTreeTraversal

     Tree - Binary Search Tree - addNodes Recursive
     Tree - Binary Search Tree - searchNode Recursive  --  NoN - Recursive -- PENDING
     Tree - Binary Search Tree - delete Recursive   --  NoN - Recursive -- PENDING
