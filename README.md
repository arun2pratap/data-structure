# Basic Data Structures
Trying out basic data structure, List, Stakc, Queqe, Trees, sorting, traversal....

com.ds.search.binary (using recursion and loop both)
    binary search with Unit Test.  Complexity = log2(n);
com.ds.sort.selection
    SelectionSort(using recursion)
            Complexity = n*2;

     QuickSort using recursion.


     LinkeDList - with insertion at start,end, arbitrary
                - remove at position.

     Tree - FunctionalTree - with depthFirstSearch
